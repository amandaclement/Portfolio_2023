          <p>My background in design and proficiency in working across the full-stack
            have led to a keen interest in designing both <span class="about-highlight">
              functional</span> and <span class="about-highlight">expressive</span>
              interactive systems using an array of languages including
              <span class="about-highlight">Java</span>, <span class="about-highlight">C++</span>,
              <span class="about-highlight">JavaScript</span>, <span class="about-highlight">HTML</span>
              and <span class="about-highlight">CSS</span> as well as tools like <span class="about-highlight">
              Unity</span> and the <span class="about-highlight">Adobe Suite</span>. With freelance experience
              in web design for client VocalTek Solutions and having worked on various academic projects while
              maintaining a 4.0 GPA during the pursuit of a <span class="about-highlight">Joint Major in Computer
              Science and Computation Arts</span> at Concordia University, Iâ€™m ready to broaden my industry
              experience by taking on new challenges.</p>

        <div class="cell-right">
          <p>After years of trying to characterize myself as either an analytical
            thinker or a creative thinker, I finally found my place in-between. This
            realization was brought on as I learned to code and discovered that a
            structured and methodical approach could lead to something abstract and
            expressive. Naturally, code became my preferred tool. While many of my
            works focus on <span class="about-highlight">functionality</span> and
            <span class="about-highlight">efficiency</span>, exploring what can emerge
            through experimentation is what motivates me most as the creation process
            relies on <span class="about-highlight">logical thinking</span> and
            <span class="about-highlight">problem-solving</span>, but the outcome is only
            vaguely predefined and predictable, and can be unexpectedly beautiful.</p>
